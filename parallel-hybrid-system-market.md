<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parallel Hybrid System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PHEV</li><li>Mild Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parallel hybrid systems combine both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) market focuses on vehicles that can be charged externally, offering extended electric-only ranges while using gasoline for longer trips. In contrast, mild hybrids enhance traditional ICE vehicles with a smaller electric motor that assists during acceleration but cannot power the vehicle alone, improving fuel efficiency without the need for external charging.</p></p>
