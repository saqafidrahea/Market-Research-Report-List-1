<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epicardial LAA Closure Devices</li><li>Endocardial LAA Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure Devices market encompasses two primary types: Epicardial and Endocardial LAA closure devices. Epicardial devices are surgically implanted on the outer layer of the heart, often during open-heart procedures, providing direct closure and reducing stroke risk. In contrast, Endocardial devices are delivered via catheterization, accessing the heart's interior to occlude the LAA. This minimally invasive approach is preferred for patients with higher surgical risks, making both device types essential in managing atrial fibrillation and preventing thromboembolic events.</p></p>
